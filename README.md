# WPMU-head-script-plugin
A simple plugin to inject a &lt;script> ... &lt;/script> line in the &lt;head> section of WordPress.  Written for WPMU, but should work just as well in straight WordPress.

To Use:
Edit lane-mega-menu.php and replace the <script>...</script> stuff with whatever you want inserted.

Upload to wp-content/plugins and enable just like any plugin.

There are no settings or menus added to Dashboard.  It just works.
